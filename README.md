## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopsphere.git
   cd ShopSphere
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   For both FrontEnd(client) and BackEnd(server):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder and add the following:
   ```env
   PORT=your_localhost_url (e.g: http://localhost:3000)
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   Run the backend and frontend servers simultaneously:
   ```bash
   #Start frontend and backend concurrently
   npm run dev
   
   # Start the backend server
   cd backend
   npm run backend

   # Start the frontend client
   cd frontend
   npm run frontend 
   ** Try to run both frontend and backend concurrently even if you are only interested in working with frontend for the website to run smoothly as frontend is heavily dependent on the backend
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.
